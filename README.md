# 💻 Product Landing Page | freeCodeCamp

## 📖 Description

This is my solution for the *Product Landing Page* at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I decided to make a lighter and simpler version of the Steam Deck's landing pages. I'm not too good when it comes to design a page from scratch, so it is far from being really good, but I'm proud of the final result. I also worked with the limitations of the freeCodeCamp's website, that means no JavaScript. I'm uploading the way I submitted there.
